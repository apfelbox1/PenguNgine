# Exercise 01

## What is the difference between git and github?
git is a version control technology that allows you to track changes in your code and collaborate with other developers. Github is a platform/website for using git.

## Name 3 benefits of a version control system:
 - You can track changes in your code
 - You can collaborate with other developers
 - You can revert to previous versions of your code

## Name 3 alternatives to git:
 - [Mercurial](https://www.mercurial-scm.org/)
 - [Perforce](https://www.perforce.com/)
 - Subversion (SVN) [ðŸ¤®](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/azure/devops/repos/git/perform-migration-from-svn-to-git?view=azure-devops)

## Name 2 differences between git and other version control systems:
 - Git is distributed, other systems are centralized
 - Git is free, other systems are not

## Name known issues related to game engines (Unreal, Unity) and version control systems:
 - Large files can cause issues with git (Graphics, 3d models, ...)
 - Git was designed for text files(coding), not binary files
 - From experience: Never work in the same scene with multiple people as the merging will almost always fail

# Exercise 03

## What is the difference between a dynamic linked library and a static library?
A dynamic linked library is a library that is loaded at runtime. A static library is linked at compile time.

## Describe a logging system with your own words:
A logging system is a system that allows you to log messages to a file or console. 
Often we don't know why a program works or doesn't work. With a logging system we can log all the information we want/need. There are different levels of logging, the most common are: trace, info, warning, debug, error, fatal. (ordered by severity)

## What is a Design Pattern?
Design patterns are solutions to common problems in software design. They are described in a format that can be used directly in your code.

## Name and describe 2 Design Patterns (except fa√ßade or adapter):
- **Singleton**: A singleton is a class that can only have one instance. This is useful when you want to have a global instance of a class. For example, you can have a global logger that can be used anywhere in your code.
- **Factory**: A factory is a class that creates other classes. This is useful when you want to create objects of a class that is not known at compile time. For example, you can have a factory that creates different types of enemies in a game.

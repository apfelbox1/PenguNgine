## About
This project is a simple game engine written in C++. Most of the project is based on the video series of [The Cherno](https://www.youtube.com/@TheCherno/playlists) on YouTube. The goal of this project is to learn more about game engines and C++.

The project is created as a student project for educational purposes.

## Installation
The project uses premake to generate the project files.

### Windows
To generate the project files for Visual Studio 2022, simply run the `GenerateProjectFiles.bat` file. This will generate all necessary project files and link the necessary libraries.

For other versions of Visual Studio, you can change the `--vs=2022` flag in the `GenerateProjectFiles.bat` file to the version you want to use.

For more control over the project files simply change the `premake5.lua` file and run the `GenerateProjectFiles.bat` file again.
